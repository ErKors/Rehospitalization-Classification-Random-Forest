# Source Data: 
Diabetes patients across 130-US hospitals between 1999-2008

# Objective:
To predict the readmittance of Diabetes patience (No readmittance, readmittance within 30 days, readmittance after 30 days) 

# Problem Statement: 
To identify the factors that lead to the high readmission rate of diabetic patients within 30 days post discharge and correspondingly to predict the high-risk diabetic-patients who are most likely to get readmitted within 30 days so that the quality of care can be improved along with improved patientâ€™s experience, health of the population and reduce costs by lowering readmission rates. Also, to identify the medicines that are the most effective in treating diabetes.
